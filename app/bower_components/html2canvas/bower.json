The screenshot is based on the DOM and as such may not be 100% accurate to the real representation as it does not make an actual screenshot, but builds the screenshot based on the information available on the page.\n\n\n###How does it work?###\nThe script renders the current page as a canvas image, by reading the DOM and the different styles applied to the elements.\n\nIt does **not require any rendering from the server**, as the whole image is created on the **clients browser**. However, as it is heavily dependent on the browser, this library is *not suitable* to be used in nodejs.\nIt doesn't magically circumvent any browser content policy restrictions either, so rendering cross-origin content will require a [proxy](https://github.com/niklasvh/html2canvas/wiki/Proxies) to get the content to the [same origin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy).\n\nThe script is still in a **very experimental state**, so I don't recommend using it in a production environment nor start building applications with it yet, as there will be still major changes made.\n\n###Browser compatibility###\n\nThe script should work fine on the following browsers:\n\n* Firefox 3.5+\n* Google Chrome\n* Opera 12+\n* IE9+\n* Safari 6+\n\nAs each CSS property needs to be manually built to be supported, there are a number of properties that are not yet supported.\n\n### Usage ###\nTo render an `element` with html2canvas, simply call:\n` html2canvas(element, options);`\n\nTo access the created canvas, provide the `onrendered` event in the options which returns the canvas element as the first argument, as such:\n\n    html2canvas(document.body, {\n        onrendered: function(canvas) {\n            /* canvas is the actual canvas element,\n               to append it to the page call for example\n               document.body.appendChild( canvas );\n            */\n        }\n    });\n\n### Building ###\n\nThe library uses [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) for building. Alternatively, you can download the latest build from [here](http://html2canvas.hertzen.com/build/html2canvas.js).\n\nRun the full build process (including lint, qunit and webdriver tests):\n\n    $ grunt\n\nSkip lint and tests and simply build from source:\n\n    $ grunt build\n\n### Running tests ###\n\nThe library has two sets of tests. The first set is a number of qunit tests that check that different values parsed by browsers are correctly converted in html2canvas. To run these tests with grunt you'll need [phantomjs](http://phantomjs.org/).\n\nThe other set of tests run Firefox, Chrome and Internet Explorer with [webdriver](https://github.com/niklasvh/webdriver.js). The selenium standalone server (runs on Java) is required for these tests and can be downloaded from [here](http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list). They capture an actual screenshot from the test pages and compare the image to the screenshot created by html2canvas and calculate the percentage differences. These tests generally aren't expected to provide 100% matches, but while commiting changes, these should generally not go decrease from the baseline values.\n\nStart by downloading the dependencies:\n\n    $ npm install\n\nRun qunit tests:\n\n    $ grunt test\n\n### Examples ###\n\nFor more information and examples, please visit the [homepage](http://html2canvas.hertzen.com) or try the [test console](http://html2canvas.hertzen.com/screenshots.html).\n\n### Contributing ###\n\nIf you wish to contribute to the project, please send the pull requests to the develop branch. Before submitting any changes, try and test that the changes work with all the support browsers. If some CSS property isn't supported or is incomplete, please create appropriate tests for it as well before submitting any code changes.\n\n### Changelog ###\n\nv0.4.1 - 7.9.2013\n * Added support for bower\n * Improved z-index ordering\n * Basic implementation for CSS transformations\n * Fixed inline text in top element\n * Basic implementation for text-shadow\n\nv0.4.0 - 30.1.2013\n * Added rendering tests with <a href=\"https://github.com/niklasvh/webdriver.js\">webdriver</a>\n * Switched to using grunt for building\n * Removed support for IE<9, including any FlashCanvas bits\n * Support for border-radius\n * Support for multiple background images, size, and clipping\n * Support for :before and :after pseudo elements\n * Support for placeholder rendering\n * Reformatted all tests to small units to test specific features\n\nv0.3.4 - 26.6.2012\n\n* Removed (last?) jQuery dependencies (<a href=\"https://github.com/niklasvh/html2canvas/commit/343b86705fe163766fcf735eb0217130e4bd5b17\">niklasvh</a>)\n* SVG-powered rendering (<a href=\"https://github.com/niklasvh/html2canvas/commit/67d3e0d0f59a5a654caf71a2e3be6494ff146c75\">niklasvh</a>)\n* Radial gradients (<a href=\"https://github.com/niklasvh/html2canvas/commit/4f22c18043a73c0c3bbf3b5e4d62714c56acd3c7\">SunboX</a>)\n* Split renderers to their own objects (<a href=\"https://github.com/niklasvh/html2canvas/commit/94f2f799a457cd29a21cc56ef8c06f1697866739\">niklasvh</a>)\n* Simplified API, cleaned up code (<a href=\"https://github.com/niklasvh/html2canvas/commit/c7d526c9eaa6a4abf4754d205fe1dee360c7660e\">niklasvh</a>)\n\nv0.3.3 - 2.3.2012\n\n* SVG taint fix, and additional taint testing options for rendering (<a href=\"https://github.com/niklasvh/html2canvas/commit/2dc8b9385e656696cb019d615bdfa1d98b17d5d4\">niklasvh</a>)\n* Added support for CORS images and option to create canvas as tainted (<a href=\"https://github.com/niklasvh/html2canvas/commit/3ad49efa0032cde25c6ed32a39e35d1505d3b2ef\">niklasvh</a>)\n* Improved minification saved ~1K!
